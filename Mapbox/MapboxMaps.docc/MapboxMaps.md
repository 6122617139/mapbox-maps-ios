# Working with Mapbox Maps

@Comment(In order to build documentation, use the MapboxMaps.xcodeproj)
The Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS is a public library for displaying interactive, thoroughly customizable maps in native iOS.

## Getting Started

The Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS is a public library for displaying interactive, thoroughly customizable maps in native iOS. It takes map styles that conform to the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/), applies them to vector tiles that conform to the [Mapbox Vector Tile Specification](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec), and renders them using Metal.

Please visit https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/beta/maps/guides/ for general information and instructions on using the Maps SDK in your iOS application.
